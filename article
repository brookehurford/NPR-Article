The Paris agreement to curb climate change calls for a dramatic shift away from fossil fuels and the greenhouse gasses they emit, especially carbon dioxide.

Switching to renewable energy helps but that won't happen fast enough to [keep temperatures from rising to dangerous levels](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/10/02/why-the-world-could-be-shifting-to-clean-energy-a-lot-faster/). That's why scientists and researchers all over the world also are working on new ways of keeping carbon out of the atmosphere.

NPR's Jeff Brady, KQED's Lauren Sommer, Wyoming Public Radio's Stephanie Joyce and Inside Energy's Leigh Paterson tracked down a few examples of this in North America.
